The College Event Page is a modern, responsive web application developed using React that provides a centralized platform to showcase various college events such as technical fests, cultural programs, and sports meets. The primary goal of this project is to apply component-based UI design and modern UI/UX principles using popular UI libraries.

In this project, Bootstrap is used for creating a responsive layout and grid system, ensuring proper alignment and adaptability across different screen sizes, while Material UI (MUI) is used for designing visually appealing and reusable UI components such as the navigation bar, cards, buttons, and typography. This combination helps achieve a clean, sleek, and professional user interface.

The application follows a well-structured React folder architecture, separating components and pages for better readability, scalability, and maintainability. Each major section of the webpage—such as the navigation bar, hero section, event cards, and footer—is implemented as a reusable React component.

The College Event Page serves as a real-world use case, where students can explore upcoming events and get an overview of event details in an organized manner. The project also lays a strong foundation for future enhancements such as event registration forms, backend integration, and database connectivity.
